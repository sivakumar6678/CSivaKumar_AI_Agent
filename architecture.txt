**Flow:**
- User interacts with Streamlit UI (topic, style, etc.)
- App fetches news from NewsAPI and/or Google News (SerpAPI)
- Articles are deduplicated and sorted
- Each article is summarized using Gemini AI
- Results (summaries, key points, insights) are shown in the UI and available for download
